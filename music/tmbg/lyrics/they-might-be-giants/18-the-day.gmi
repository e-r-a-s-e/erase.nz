# Song: The Day
## Album: They Might Be Giants
### Year: 1986

The day Marvin Gaye
And Phil Ochs got married
The trees all waved
Their giant arms

And happiness bled
From every street corner
And biplanes bombed
With fluffy pillows

The day Marvin Gaye
And Phil Ochs got married
The trees all waved
Their giant arms

And happiness bled
From every street corner
And biplanes bombed
With fluffy pillows
